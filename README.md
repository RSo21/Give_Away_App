# Give away app

in progress "form" give away


## General info

The goal of the project is to create a place where everyone can give unnecessary items to trusted institutions.

The project is a website with a simple form that will help users donate things.


## Idea

* You have things in your home that you want to get rid of, but you don't know how.
* There are many solutions available, but many require additional effort or are not trusted. You need to go to verified places, and there is no time / there is no way to go there, and containers under the house or local collections are unverified and it is not known whether these things will actually go to those in need.
